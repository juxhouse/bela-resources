The Browser for Enterprise-Level Architecture

A tool by Nubank and [Jux](https://jux.house) to visualize and navigate any software architecture, from high-level business domains down to projects and code.

## Features

- Simple, familiar [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) notation.
- Diagramming effort elimination by importing your *built* architecture elements and their inter-dependencies: domains, teams, projects, packages, classes, libs, etc.
- Central, shared source-of-truth for your manually *modeled* elements.
- Discovery, navigation and drilling-in and out of dynamically generated diagrams.
