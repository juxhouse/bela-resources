# Install the Dependencies of Your JS and TS Projects

Make sure your project has its dependencies installed. You can skip this step if your dependencies are already installed.

You can use npm, Yarn and other package managers. This is an example for a simple npm project:
```sh
  npm ci
```

You are now ready to [go back](/CodeSynchronization.md) and run the BELA Updater for JS/TS.
