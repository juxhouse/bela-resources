# Updating BELA with your .NET Projects

## 1. Preparation: Restore Your Projects

In order for BELA to detect dependencies your project may have to external packages, make sure you restore your project storing its dependencies in the .bela folder.

Example for a simple .NET project:

```
dotnet restore --packages ./.bela/dependencies
```

## 2. Run the Bela Updater

**Inside your repo folder** run the bela-updater docker app. It analyses the projects in your repo and generates the `bela-update.json` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It runs with network=none for secure containment.

An example using the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` env var as source. Adapt it with your own [source](/Concepts.md#sources):
```
docker run --network=none --pull=always \
           -v ./.bela:/.bela \
           -v .:/workspace:ro \
           juxhouse/bela-updater-dotnet -source "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY"
```

You may also want to run it while stablishing your own [parent element](/Concepts.md#parent-element).
### Ignoring test files

If you want to stop your test files from being displayed in BELA, you can use the flag `exclude-test-projects`.

In addition to using the flag, your test project .csproj file must have the IsTestProject tag set to true. Example:
```csharp
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
  ...
    <IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

### Creating a parent element  

You may also use the flag
