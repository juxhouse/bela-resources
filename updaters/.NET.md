# Updating BELA with your .NET Projects

## 1. Restore Your Solutions Folder

**Inside your project folder** restore its dependencies into the `.bela/dependencies` folder. It will be created if it does not yet exist.

Example for a simple .NET project:

```
dotnet restore --packages ./.bela/dependencies
```

## 2. Run the Bela Updater

- [Running with minimal setup](#Running-with-minimal-setup)
- [Running ignoring test files](#Running-ignoring-test-files)
- [Running with parent element](#Running-anonymously)

### Running with minimal setup

**Inside your repo folder** run the bela-updater docker app. It analyses the projects in your repo and generates the `bela-update.json` file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It runs with network=none for secure containment.

An example using the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` env var as source. Adapt it with your own [source](/Concepts.md#sources):
```
docker run --network=none --pull=always \
           -v ./.bela:/.bela \
           -v .:/workspace:ro \
           juxhouse/bela-updater-dotnet -source "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY"
```

### Running ignoring test files

If you want to stop your test files from being displayed in BELA, you can add the flag `exclude-test-projects`. Also, your test project .csproj file must have the `IsTestProject` tag set to true. Example:
```csharp
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
  ...
    <IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

### Running with parent element  

In order to integrate with your telemetry tools, you may use the flag `parent-element-path`. This flag is useful for integrating your project's code with higher-level elements of your architecture. For example, you can indicate that your project's code belongs to one of your services. 
This flag value is a string that represents the element that contains your project's code. Example:
```
  -parent-element-path "service/my-service-name"
``` 

## 3. Upload to BELA
