# Restore Your .NET Project

Make sure you are in your project's folder.

Follow the instructions below depending on whether your project uses **.NET Core** or **.NET Framework**. 

## .NET Core
For a project using .NET Core, restore its packages in the `./.bela/dependencies` folder. Here is an example using `dotnet`:
```
dotnet restore --packages ./.bela/dependencies
```

## .NET Framework
For a project using .NET Framework, use your preferred restore tool, such as msbuild or nuget, and make sure the packages folder is created **inside** the project folder and not somewhere else.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> .NET's default restore behavior is to generate the packages folder **inside** the project already, but certain configurations and env vars can override that.

Below are examples using **msbuild** and **nuget**:
```
msbuild -t:restore
```
```
nuget restore
```
