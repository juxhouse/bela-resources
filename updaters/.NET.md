# Updating BELA with your .NET Projects

## Preparation: Build Your Projects

Make sure your projects are built. You can skip this step if the projects in your repository are already built.

Example for a simple .NET project:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet build --no-restore
```

## 1. Run the Bela Updater

The bela-updater docker app analyses the projects in your repo and generates the bela-update.json file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It runs with network=none for secure containment.

An example using the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` env var as source. Adapt with your own source:
```
docker run --network=none --pull=always \
           -v ./:/workspace/ \
           juxhouse/bela-updater-dotnet -source "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY"
```

## 2. Upload to BELA

See [upload example](/updaters/reference/upload-example.md).
