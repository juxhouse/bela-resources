# BELA "How To"

This is a list of essential, non-obvious BELA features.

> [!TIP]
> This page will not waste your time with obvious features. Reading it will make your life easier and happier.

## Non-Obvious Mouse Button Actions

 - **Double-click on element:** expand/collapse element, to display its contents.
 - **Right-click on element:** Open element menu.
 - **Right-click on diagram background:** Open diagram menu.
 - **Right-click on dependency line:** Open dependency menu.
 - **Drag element:** Move element in or out of a container or simply move it to nudge the automatic layout.
 - **Right-drag:** Scroll diagram in all directions.
 - **Mouse wheel:** Zoom in/out (like Google maps).

If youâ€™re not using a standard 2-button mouse, check how your pointing device maps these actions. On Mac trackpads, for example, a two-finger tap acts as right-click, while a soft press and two-finger drag scrolls the diagram.

## Diagram Legend

There is a question-mark icon on the bottom-left of the screen. It opens a pop-up key to BELA's graphical elements.

## Disabled Buttons and Menu Actions

Every time you see a disabled button or menu action, you can hover over it to see **WHY** that item is disabled.

## Search

When searching for diagrams or elements, you can type a fragment of their name and type.

Typing: `Person` will return:
  - `getPerson() [method]`
  - `PersonController [class]`
  - `PersonImpl [class]`

you can use an asterisk `*` to represent any part of the name and type.

Typing: `Pers*[cla` will return:
  - `PersonController [class]`
  - `PersonImpl [class]`

You can use the `only modeled` icon ðŸŽ¨ in the search field to search only for [modeled](https://github.com/juxhouse/bela-resources/blob/main/Concepts.md#built-vs-modeled) diagrams and elements.

## Bulk Deletion (Non-Feature)

BELA does not support bulk deletion of modeled elements. That is intentional.

## Manual Diagram Layout (Non-Feature)

BELA does not support manual "artistic" layout of diagram elements. Manual layouts are brittle. People get emotionally attached to them and resist necessary architectural change because of that.

## Dependency Labels (Non-Feature)

Labels on dependency lines tend to create clutter and are only legible at high zoom levels, regardless of the tool. For this reason, BELA does not support them. BELA diagrams are designed to be dynamically browsed, not printed on paper. Instead of zooming in and out to read labels, simply click a dependency in BELA to see its details.
