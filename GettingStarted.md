# Getting Started with BELA

 - [Schedule an onboarding call](https://calendar.app.google/C5y4SqGjAE8CDKuz5) at your earliest convenience.

In the meantime, get a jump start:

 - Visit the [BELA homepage](https://bela.live).
 - Get a solid grasp of the fundamental [BELA Concepts](Concepts.md).
 - Optional: [Analyze a sofware project](CodeSynchronization.md) and explore the generated architecture file that will be sent to BELA.

"Stop drowning in complexity. Start navigating."
