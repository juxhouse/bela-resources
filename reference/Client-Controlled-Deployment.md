# Client-Controlled Deployment
(AKA "On-premisses", AKA "Bring Your Own Cloud")

With an enterprise account you can deploy BELA in your own environment.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

You can activate SSO in BELA using the OAuth2 OpenID standard (not SAML).

Register BELA as an application with your SSO provider. Use this as the redirect URI: `https://{your-bela-host}/callback`

Add the following properties to the [bela.properties](/reference/bela.properties.md) file:

|Key|Value|
|---|-----|
| openid.client.id | The client id for BELA generated by your SSO provider above.
| openid.client.secret | The client secret for BELA generated by your SSO provider above.
| openid.configuration.url | The configuration URL for your SSO provider. It follows the pattern: `https://{host}/.well-known/openid-configuration`
