# bela.properties

When you first run the BELA container, it will create this file:

```bash
   $HOST_DIRECTORY/config/bela.properties
```

Edit that file to provide settings for BELA, such as external API URLs and secrets.

## Example

A sample bela.properties file with configuration details:

```properties
# The email of the owner of the BELA installation within your organization.
owner.email=person@your-company.com

# URL for your SSO provider's OpenID configuration. It must follow this pattern:
openid.configuration.url=https://{host}/.well-known/openid-configuration
# Client ID for BELA, as provided by your SSO provider.
openid.client.id=your-client-id
# Client secret for BELA, as provided by your SSO provider.
openid.client.secret=your-client-secret

# Enable this instead of the openid configs above if you want to use user+password authentication:
# auth.passwords=true
# Enable this instead of the password configs above if you want open, anonymous access:
# anonymous=true

# Token for accessing BELA's architecture API endpoint. You can set any string of random letters and digits.
architecture.api.token=your-api-token

# URL for OpenAI's chat completion API endpoint.
openai.api.url=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
# API token for authenticating with OpenAI.
openai.api.token=openai-api-token
```

## Single Sign-On (SSO) (Optional)

You can activate SSO in BELA using OAuth2 OpenID (not SAML).

1. Register BELA as an application with your SSO provider. Use this as the redirect URI: `https://{your-bela-host}/callback`

Examples for some popular providers:
- [Google](/reference/SSO-Google.md)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](/reference/SSO-Microsoft-Entra-ID.md)
- [Okta](/reference/SSO-Okta.md)

2. Add the following properties to the `bela.properties` file above:

|Property|Value|
|--------|-----|
| openid.client.id | The client id for BELA generated by your SSO provider above.
| openid.client.secret | The client secret for BELA generated by your SSO provider above.
| openid.configuration.url | The configuration URL for your SSO provider. It follows the pattern: `https://{host}/.well-known/openid-configuration`

## User+Password Authentication (Optional)

If you do not want to use SSO, you can enable this line in the template above:
```
auth.passwords=true
```
> [!WARNING]
> Anyone will be able to log in using the `owner.email` set above until the password for that email is reset the first time.

## Anonymous Access (Optional)

If you are just trying out BELA, you can enable this line in the template above:
```
anonymous=true
```
Anyone will be able access BELA without needing to log in.
